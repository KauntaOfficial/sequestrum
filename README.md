## Description
A modern, lightweight dotfile manager for the masses. This README.md may look daunting, but trust me on this, it's as easy as pie.
Promise. Now you may be wondering, why use this over Stow or Dotbot. Simple. Well for starters, the name is better. Do you need any
other reasons? Fine, fine.. some real reasons. This is specifically made for dotfile/theme management and provides features like a packaging system, 
metapackaging, and more to come!

If you'd like to contribute, whether that'd be improving the comments or README (which could always use work), or adding functionality,
just fork this, add to it, then send a merge request. I'll try and get around to looking at it as soon as possible.
